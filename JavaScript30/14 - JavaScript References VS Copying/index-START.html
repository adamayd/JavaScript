    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team);

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    
    console.log(players, team, team2);
    team2[3] = 'Poppy';
    console.log(players, team, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Poppy';
    console.log(players, team, team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Poppy';
    console.log(players, team, team4);

    // or use Array.from
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    team5[3] = 'Poppy';
    console.log(players, team, team5);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Adam Ayd',
      age: 39
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.age = 99;
    console.log(person, captain);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const capt2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 39});
    console.log(person, captain, capt2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const capt3 = {...person}; NOT YET AVAILABLE

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
